# React Together Workshop - Next.js Demo

A Next.js demonstration of [react-together](https://react-together.dev/) hooks for real-time collaboration features.

## What is React Together?

React Together is an AI-friendly library that makes it incredibly easy to add real-time collaboration to your React applications. You can simply paste documentation pages into your LLM chat (like Cursor) and it works seamlessly!

## Features Demonstrated

This example has the provider setup.

Moreover, it shows the connected users.

## Getting Started

1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Run the development server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Open the app:**
   Navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

4. **Test real-time features:**
   - Open the page in multiple browser windows
   - Share the link with others
   - Watch as interactions sync in real-time!

## Sharing with Others (ngrok setup)

To share your demo with others outside your local network:

1. **Install ngrok:**
   ```bash
   npm install -g ngrok
   # or use: brew install ngrok
   ```

2. **Get a static domain** (recommended):
   - Sign up at [ngrok.com](https://ngrok.com) 
   - Get a free static domain from your dashboard
   - This gives you a consistent URL like `your-app.ngrok-free.app`

3. **Configure multisynq API settings:**
   - Go to your [multisynq dashboard](https://multisynq.io)
   - Add your ngrok static URL to the allowed domains list
   - This ensures your API key works with the ngrok domain

4. **Start ngrok tunnel:**
   ```bash
   ngrok http 3000 --domain=your-static-domain.ngrok-free.app
   ```

5. **Share the ngrok URL:**
   - Send the ngrok URL to others
   - Everyone can now see real-time updates together!

ðŸ’¡ **Pro tip**: Static domains prevent you from having to reconfigure multisynq settings every time you restart ngrok.
